# Class-Help-in-a-SNAP-BootcampGIS
#This project was completed for the class 'Analyzing pandemic food insecurity using data science and GIS' as part of the curriculum of a BootcampGIS Enterprise certificate
#
#I followed along with the instructors code for taking 2007, 2017, and 2018 SNAP data from the government to help predict what variables can influence food insecurity in times of meed.
# I then took my final predicted model and visualized the most significant variables using QGIS to create a mao of the continental United States.
# Finally, I reiterated my Random Forest model in order to increase its accuracy.
